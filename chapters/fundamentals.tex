\section{Virtual memory}
\index{virtual memory}

In the 'good old days' of the 8-bit microcomputers one program ran at a time and
everybody could access any part of the memory. These were subdivided into ROM
(Read-Only Memory), RAM (Random-Access Memory), video memory, device memory and
various system-defined ranges (for example the

\section{Paging}

Keeping a track of memory raises a practical issue -- if we need metadata to
keep track of things such as whether a certain part of memory is allocated or
not, then we can't keep track of things at a byte granularity or we'd end up in
the absurd situation where each byte of memory requires (at least) a byte to
describe it.\\

We therefore have to divide memory up into blocks. These blocks are called
\emph{pages}.
