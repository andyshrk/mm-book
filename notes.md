# Rough notes

(absolutely rough and ready, raw, harebrained nonsense only I can understand)

## TODOs

* Cover stress-ng somehow.

* Use Chris Down's [excellent talk](https://media.ccc.de/v/arch-conf-online-2020-6390-linux-memory-management-at-scale) and [blog post](https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html) as inspiration - which [I took notes on](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/linux-mm-notes/blob/master/chris_down.md) in the linux-mm-notes repo.

* Cover the whole linux swap controversy.
